# Backbone with Pets API
An assigment completed during my time as a student at Ada Developers Academy.

Original Instructions:
----

Create a single page application, using backbone, to interact with the [Pets API](https://github.com/AdaGold/pets_api). Instead of having static data written in app.js and losing data any data entered through the browser,   

This is an exercise to practice integrating an API into a backbone application while building the model, controller and views. This exercise will not be turned in.

### Learning Goals
- Review creating backbone components
  - Models
  - Controllers
  - Views
- Use backbone to read data from an API
- Create and update data to an API, through backbone

### Setup
- Fork and clone this repository
- cd into `pets-api-exercise-backbone`
- Run `npm install` and `npm start` in terminal


### Requirements

Files for the Backbone components and some HTML has already been setup for you. Review the `index.html` and the `/src/app` directory before starting.


Utilize the available endpoints of the [Pets API](https://github.com/AdaGold/pets_api) to implement the following features (prioritize bolded items):

- **Show a list of pets**
- Show information on a specific pet
- **Create a new pet**
- **Delete a pet**
- Update if a pet has been vaccinated
  - Hint: Read more about the [checkbox input element ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7851868/whats-the-proper-value-for-a-checked-attribute-of-an-html-checkbox)
